# sky-website
It's a Personal-Blog Website Template in which HTML and CSS are used. All the code and images optimized for a better speed. In the CSS I prevented code redundancy and mostly all pages inherit common properties from their parent. The design is responsive and mobile-first. I've published via Github Pages.
